The Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering Technology (BS-CET) is an NTC-recognized program offered at Electrical Engineering Department that combines hands-on experience with modern hardware tools and strong software knowledge. The program is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice, preparing students for real-world engineering challenges.

Students gain exposure to key areas of computer technology such as IoT, embedded systems, web and software development, while also building a solid foundation in electronics, communication systems, and computer networks. While essential theoretical concepts are covered, the program places a stronger emphasis on practical learning, laboratory work, and applied engineering skills, making the learning experience less rote and more impactful.
