INTRODUCTION
DHA Suffa university’s BS in Data Science program is designed to help students understand vast volume of data generated as a result of latest modern data revolution. The specific syllabus enables the students to design sophisticated computing techniques in order to process this volume of information by designing expertise in machine learning, big data analysis and algorithmic complexity as well as skill development in mathematics and statistical modeling and algorithm design.
This program is suitable for students interested in either career in industry or to pursue more specialized graduate study. This program helps students to prepare career in data analysis, combining foundational statistical concepts with computational principal from computer science. The major part of this program is final year project, that teaches students about implementation of statistical and computational principal to solve large range, real world data analysis problems.

BS (Data Science) program is a four-year degree program and accredited by NCEAC (National Computing Education Accreditation Council).
