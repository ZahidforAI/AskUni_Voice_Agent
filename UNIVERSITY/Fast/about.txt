About Our University
The National University of Computer & Emerging Sciences is the first multi-campus private sector university set up under the Federal Charter granted by Ordinance No.XXIII of 2000, dated July 01, 2000.


The University started with an impressive advantage in that, thanks to the Foundation FAST’s selfless, ceaseless, and imaginative efforts, it inherited four first-rate computer science institutes located in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and Peshawar, in spacious buildings and prestigious settings.

These institutes, individually and collectively, have established leadership positions due to the splendid vision of enlightened management and the tireless efforts of a highly qualified faculty. Over the years FAST has become the hallmark of excellence in the academic arena, domestic market, and international community.
