The Department of Architecture and Planning was initiated in 2000 as part of the initial NED University Master Plan. The department started off as an undergraduate programme and in 2002, and advanced to a graduate level in the fields of Urban and Regional Planning and Architecture.

The Department of Architecture and Planning strives to impart quality education, foster research and scholastic pursuits as well as generate useful human resource for the broader socio-economic development of the country. Various allied disciplines and facilities at the University act as supportive factors in cross disciplinary academic exchange.

At present the Department of Architecture and Planning is proudly located in the Old Campus, situated in the heart of the Old City of Karachi, consisting of buildings that go back to 1935.

After 25 years of disuse, in 2001, work on the restoration and renovation of the Old Campus started under the guidance of the NED Heritage Cell. In 2004 the Architecture and Planning Department shifted in the City Campus.
