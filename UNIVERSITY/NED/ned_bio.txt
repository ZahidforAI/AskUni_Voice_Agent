Biomedical engineering is the application of engineering knowledge and skills to human biology, healthcare and medicine.

It combines the design and problem-solving skills of engineering with medical, physical, chemical, biological and computational sciences to help improve patient health care and the quality of life.

It advances fundamental concepts, generates knowledge from molecular to organ systems level and develops innovative biologics, materials, processes, implants, devices and informatics approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, serves in health improvement and patient rehabilitation.
At NED University of Engineering and Technology, our goal is to transform and improve future healthcare through innovations and advances in biomedical engineering.
