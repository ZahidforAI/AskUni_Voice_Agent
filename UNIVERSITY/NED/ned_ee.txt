The Department of Electrical Engineering is rich both in its history as well as in what it currently has in offers. The undergraduate programme in Electrical Engineering may be traced back to 1934 when the former NED Engineering College introduced a three year Bachelor of Engineering degree course. It was modified to 3-1/2 years duration in 1943-44. A full four year Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical) degree programme was introduced in 1961.
The undergraduate programme has since been expanding continuously- both internally as well as in contributing and collaborating with industry sector. The once lonely Department of Electrical Engineering has contributed in the development of three other engineering disciplines namely, Computer and Information Systems , Electronic and Telecommunications – thus strengthening the faculty. Our undergraduate internship programme is intense which gives adequate exposure to the students. 
The Department also holds a strong post-graduate setup. A Masters in Electrical Engineering degree (Evening Programme) by course work / Project has been offered by this department since 1984. The programme has seen modifications at various stages and currently offers a semester based M.Engg. degree programme in various specialisations. The Department, having felt the need of industry for having human resource with refined management skills – acknowledged and timely launched a well-balanced Masters Programme in Engineering Management (MEM). It currently emphasises on energy management specialisation.
