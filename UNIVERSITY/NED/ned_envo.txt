About Department
Environmental Engineering is one of five departments in the Faculty of Civil and Petroleum Engineering (CPL) at NED University of Engineering and Technology. The Institute of Environmental Engineering & Research was established in 1985, at NED University as a Centre of Excellence for development of environmental engineering education and research. In 1997, the institute was later renamed as a department of this University. Our department works closely with industries, government and regulatory authorities, and focus particularly on environmental and societal impacts.

The department offers postgraduate programmes in Environmental Engineering and Environmental Management. Our courses encompass the full spectrum of environmental engineering from water and wastewater treatment to air pollution control to municipal and industrial solid waste management while continuing to provide a sound understanding of environmental engineering principles. At present, research activities are focused on sustainable water and wastewater treatment and renewable energy. The department has a strong and competent foreign qualified team which assures to provide high standard academic and research services. Our students are highly recruited and the graduates are widely regarded as among the most work ready engineers. Environmental Engineering at NED University is one of the largest EE postgraduate programme in the country.
