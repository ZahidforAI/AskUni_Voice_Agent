The Department of Earthquake Engineering was established at NED University of Engineering and Technology in 2011. The Department benefits from the earlier activities in the area of earthquake engineering through Cowasjee Earthquake Study Centre (CESNED) that was previously administered by the Department of Civil Engineering. The underlying purpose of the Department is to develop highly skilled professionals and researchers who are trained in various aspects of earthquake mitigation so that they are able to serve the society through better planning and preparation. The Department offers courses, designed to suit the needs of professional engineers working in the construction industry as well as to strengthen already existing research activities in the area of earthquake engineering and related disciplines.
