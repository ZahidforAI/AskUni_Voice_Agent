Welcome to the Department of Urban and Infrastructure Engineering at NED University of Engineering & Technology.

In today’s rapidly urbanizing world, conventional Civil Engineering alone is no longer sufficient to tackle the complex challenges cities face. Our department offers a forward-looking and interdisciplinary specialization Urban Engineering designed to meet the evolving demands of modern infrastructure, smart mobility, and sustainable urban development.

Our Outcome-Based Education (OBE) Level II accredited program, offered under the B.E. Civil umbrella, integrates strong Civil Engineering foundations with cutting-edge technologies such as Geo-Informatics, Remote Sensing, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics, and Urban Simulation Modeling. This ensures that our graduates meet both local and international standards and are equipped with the digital competencies essential for the cities of tomorrow.

To further strengthen professional capacity and address real-world urban transportation issues, the department also offers a Master of Engineering Management (MEM) in Transportation Infrastructure Management, conducted in the evening and on weekends. This program is especially tailored to working professionals and aims to produce leaders who can contribute practical, impactful solutions for the improvement of city infrastructure.

At the research level, the department proudly offers a PhD program, focusing on micro-level solutions to the macro-level challenges faced by large urban centers. Our faculty members supervise high-impact doctoral research both locally and through collaborations with international universities, ensuring a global outlook on urban problem-solving.

Our academic team is actively involved in applied research and mentoring, guiding students through projects in areas such as traffic congestion, disaster management, flood resilience, earthquake-resistant design, infrastructure sustainability, and smart cities. Graduates of our department are now serving in key positions across the public and private sectors, research institutes, and global organizations, while others continue their journey in advanced studies and innovation.

Since our inception in 2006, we have developed strong partnerships with international institutions, including a Memorandum of Understanding with the IMOB—University of Hasselt (Belgium), which enables joint research, faculty-student exchange, and co-supervised PhD programs. We have also established a state-of-the-art GIS laboratory in collaboration with Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU), Canada.

Locally, we are privileged to have earned the confidence of major urban stakeholders such as the Government of Sindh, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, Karachi Development Authority, Traffic and Motorways Police, Sindh Building Control Authority, and the Traffic Engineering Bureau. We also maintain collaborative research links with prestigious institutions including the Aga Khan University Hospital, Jinnah Sindh Medical University, and the University of Karachi.

We warmly welcome you to explore our academic programs, research initiatives, and the dynamic role that Urban Engineers are playing in shaping livable, resilient, and sustainable cities for future generations.
