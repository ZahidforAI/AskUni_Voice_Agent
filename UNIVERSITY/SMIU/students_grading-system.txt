Performance of the students in the examination shall be assessed on the basis of the marks obtained from a total of 100 marks in each course. The marks obtained shall be presented as Numerical Grade (N.G) and Alphabetical Grade (A.G) as explained below.
Assessment of performance on the basis of marks out of 100 fixed for a course recommended in course outlines of different disciplines will be termed as Numerical Grade (NG).
Equivalent of numerical grade in terms of alphabets shall be termed as Alphabetical grades (AG) and each letter carries a value in terms of numerical points termed as Grade Point Average (GPA).
Over all grading for the declaration of result will be based on Gradation System for representing actual achievements of a candidate as follows:

Semester Grade Point Average (GPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Averages (CGPAs) will be calculated using the following relationships:
GPA = Sum over Courses in Semester (Course Credit Hours X Grade Point Earned)
Total Semester Credit Hours
CGPA = Sum over all taken Courses in all Semesters (Course Credit Hours X Grade Point Earned)
Total Credit Hours Taken in all Semesters
