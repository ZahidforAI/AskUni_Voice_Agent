WHAT IS THE UNIVERSITY OF KARACHI?

The University of Karachi (UoK) is the largest public-sector university in Pakistan and one of the oldest and most prestigious institutions of higher education in the country. It serves as a teaching university, research university, and affiliating and examining body for colleges across Karachi and Sindh.

ESTABLISHMENT AND LEGAL STATUS

The University of Karachi was established through an Act of the Parliament of Pakistan in June 1951.
Initially, it functioned as a Federal University.

In 1962, through another act of parliament, the university’s status was redefined as a provincial university of Sindh.
